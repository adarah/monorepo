# Raytracer
This is a fun project I've started to learn a bit about how computer graphics work. You can find some .ppm images in the `pictures` directory which showcase the project's evolution.
This project is based on the book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley. I recommend it to any beginners like me.
